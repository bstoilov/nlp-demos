### Handwritten digits training data

mnist data set can be downloaded from [here](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)

you will need all four files, in order for the code to work rename them like:
t10k-images-idx3-ubyte
t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte
train-images-idx3-ubyte
train-labels-idx1-ubyte

wath for dashes and dots, you will see errors in the python package anyway
